# Data-Structure
## Goal
It's Mainly for a self-practice project. I will try implement some common data structure in C programming language first, then try implement it in Python or C++.

## Features
* Support generic type (type-unsafe)
* Marco free
* Easy to understand

## Implemented Data Structure
* Vector
* Linked List
* Stack
* Tree
  * Binary Tree

## Todo List
* Refactor vector, linked list and stack code
* Create vector elements with instance instead of using pointer
* Check for exsistence of dangling pointers
